# c_dsa__nov
this repo is created for c and dsa learning c and dsa at nov 2024
This repository contains various programs, implementations, and notes that I am working on while learning the C programming language and studying fundamental data structures and algorithms. The focus is on building a strong understanding of core concepts, problem-solving techniques, and practical coding skills that are essential for technical interviews and software development.

The materials include:
- C programming concepts (e.g., variables, functions, arrays, pointers, memory management)
- Basic to advanced data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash tables)
- Algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, graph algorithms)
- Problem-solving strategies and solutions
